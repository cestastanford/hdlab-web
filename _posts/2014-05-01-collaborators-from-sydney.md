We are very pleased to welcome back to CESTA Jacquie Kasunic and Kate Sweetapple. During their first visit in November 2013 we new we wanted to find a way to work together. Keith Baker and Dan Edelstein came forward with a project to visualize the process by which the Declaration of the Rights of Man came to be written during the summer of 1789.
