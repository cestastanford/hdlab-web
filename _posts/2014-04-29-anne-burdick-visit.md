Anne arrived on Monday April 28 to meet with CESTA project leads to learn about what we are doing in preparation for an [upcoming Design Research Society conference at Umea, Sweden](http://www.designresearchsociety.org/joomla/events/biennial-conf/drs2014umea.html). It was quiet in the lab late Monday, which gave her time to have long discussions with Nick Bauch about his project. Gabe Wolfenstein gave her a tour of CESTA's Crowdsourcing project. Both projects had unexpected connections with the work she presented the next day: 'Micro Mega Meta.'

She showed us part one of a three-part pecha-kucha called Trina, which she describes as "a design fiction conceived in collaboration with writer Janet Sarbanes (Army of One) that aims to imagine a digital environment built upon Humanities notions such as subjectivity, interpretation, ambiguity and contextual specificity."
