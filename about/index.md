Humanities + Design was founded in 2012 by Dan Edelstein, Paula Findlen, and Nicole Coleman. It is a laboratory member of the [Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA)](http://cesta.stanford.edu) on the 4th floor of Wallenberg Hall. 

Our mission is to produce, through the lens of humanistic inquiry, new modes of thinking in design and computer science to serve data-driven research in the humanities. We believe that humanistic inquiry, grounded in interpretation, has much to contribute to the development of technologies if they are to help us reveal ambiguity and paradox, allowing human-scale exploration of complex systems. 

In the laboratory environment, theoretical and methodological discussions happen side-by-side with hands-on work with digital materials. Humanities scholars and students, designers, engineers, and computer scientists engage together in ongoing tool design as defined by the specific needs of participating humanities projects.
