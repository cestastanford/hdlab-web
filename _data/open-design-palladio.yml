  details: "Jon, Corey and Adam all had data that included numeric values. For Corey it was the size of ships, for Jon it was the number of coins in a coin horde. They needed to be able to apply those numbers as values for the size of points on a map or graph. Now with version 0.5.0 that is possible."
