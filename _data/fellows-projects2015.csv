Vladimir Hamed-Troyansky,Vladimir,Hamed-Troyansky,2015-16,https://0.academia-photos.com/311013/92051/427902/s200_vladimir.troyansky.jpg,"Chechen Refugees Between the Ottoman and Russian Empires, 1866-1871<br />and Networks of Capital in Ottoman Amman, 1890-1908","Vladimir Hamed-Troyansky (PhD Candidate, History) studies refugee migration in the late Ottoman Empire. His dissertation explores the political economy of North Caucasus refugee settlements in the northern Balkans and the southern Levant, as well as the construction of refugee networks within and across imperial borders. Based on the archival data that he collected in Turkey, Jordan, Georgia, Russia, and Bulgaria, he works on two digital history projects as a CESTA graduate fellow.  Vladimir’s first project analyzes the return migration of Chechen refugees from their settlements in Ottoman Anatolia and Syria to Chechnya, part of the Russian Empire. Vladimir utilizes Tsarist police records to map the readmittance and deportation of Chechen returnees in 1867-71.  Vladimir’s second project investigates the economic development of Amman, a Circassian refugee settlement that would become the capital city of Jordan. Drawing on Ottoman land records, Vladimir adopts digital tools to visualize the networks of capital in Ottoman Amman in 1890-1914. His project traces real estate transactions between the town’s Circassian entrepreneurs and Syrian and Palestinian merchants."
Anja Krieger,Anja,Krieger,2015-16,/img/people/akrieger.jpg,"People, Ships, and the Sea: Seafaring in the Eastern Mediterranean, c. 1600 BCE to c. 50 BCE","Anja Krieger (PhD candidate, Classics/Archaeology) is examining changes in seafaring and maritime trade in the Eastern Mediterranean from the Bronze Age to the Hellenistic Period, that is from mid-2nd millennium BCE to mid-2nd century BCE. Using evidence from shipwrecks I will illustrate how the modalities and development of maritime trade and connectivity changed through several time periods. At its core the dissertation argues that by analyzing the cargo composition of single wrecks as well as their distribution and provenance we can assess changes of shipping behavior and degrees of intentionality in maritime trade as well as levels of intensity within maritime trade and gain a better understanding of the relationships between local, regional and long-distance trade subsystems."
George Philip LeBourdais,George Philip,LeBourdais,2015-16,/img/people/gplebourdais.jpg,An Aesthetics of Ice: William Bradford's Arctic Regions,"George Philip (GP) LeBourdais is a doctoral candidate in the department of art history at Stanford University. His research focuses on the history of photography, ranging from nineteenth-century landscape imagery to 1960s Civil Rights photojournalism. </br>Tracing the life and work of the marine painter William Bradford through his groundbreaking 1873 photographic book The Arctic Regions, George Philip's dissertation explores the aesthetics of ice nineteenth-century America. The project comprises six chapters that explore six rare copies of the book, explaining how the places they currently reside illuminate themes at the core of the nineteenth-century aesthetics of ice. </br>Chapter titles are “Stillness and Movement” at the Whaling Museum in New Bedford, Massachusetts; “Transformations” at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; “Black and White” at Harvard University; “Reflections” at the British Library, London; “Crystallizations” in San Francisco; and “Periphery and Core” in Washington, D.C. This geographic approach foregrounds not only how Bradford brought the Arctic home to America, but also how the representation of ice contributed to the system of environmental and artistic values that we have inherited today.</br>As a CESTA DH fellow, George Philip is developing a series of maps in the Spatial History Lab that trace concentric geographies of The Arctic Regions, including: the 1869 journey to Greenland that led to the production of the book; locations of surviving copies of the book; and the series of public lectures, illustrated by lantern slide projections of the book’s photographs, that Bradford performed across the United States.

Jens Pohlmann,Jens,Pohlmann,2015-16,/img/people/jpohlmann.jpg,Mapping the German Cultural Sphere – A Digital Network Analysis of Siegfried Unseld’s Travel Notes,"In cooperation with the German Literary Archives in Marbach, Jens Pohlmann (PhD candidate, German Studies) is currently working on a digital network analysis of the travel notes of Siegfried Unseld, the head of the Suhrkamp publishing house. These notes contain information on an immense number of German and international authors, their meetings with the publisher, and the topics they discussed. The collection and preparation of this data will allow for illuminating visualizations of the literary and cultural German public sphere from the 1950s to the 1990s and enable further innovative research approaches to the materials in Marbach. After extracting the metadata from these typewriter documents, Jens will develop first visualizations of Suhrkamp’s network based on Palladio."
Laura C. Rogers,Laura,Rogers,2015-16,/img/people/lcrogers.jpg,Navigating the Archive of Helen and Newton Harrison,"Laura C. Rogers (PhD candidate, Modern Thought and Literature) is writing a dissertation on the 50-year career of two artists and university professors named Helen and Newton Harrison. Stanford acquired and is now processing the Harrison archive and Laura goes weekly to sift through the materials. Given the complexity, range of materials (230 linear feet), and wide-ranging contributions to art, science, and politics, at the beginning of the 2015-2016 academic year, Laura augmented her dissertation research methods to include a CESTA digital humanities project. She has initiated her CESTA project with data modeling, whereby she is developing a schema for a set of tables with multiple dimensions such that she can upload those tables into the web-based visualization platform Palladio (product of Stanford’s Humanities + Design Lab). Her writing will then build from this flexible research platform, which is not driven by the need to demonstrate comprehensive knowledge about the Harrisons’ career as if to synthesize or contain it. Instead, Laura is using Palladio to discover conceptual and aesthetic patterns that may exist from one project to another, investigating how the Harrisons have advanced the notion of “arts research” in the fields of ecology and social practice since the late 1960s and 1970s, with special attention to the influence of Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.), the LACMA exhibition on Art & Technology, and Osaka World Expo '70."
Stephen Sansom,Stephen,Sansom,2015-16,/img/people/ssansom.jpg,The Poetics of Style in the Shield of Heracles,"Stephen Sansom (PhD candidate, Classics) specializes in early Greek poetry and poetics. His dissertation performs a stylistic analysis of the lesser known archaic Greek poem, *The Shield of Heracles*, according to its use of traditional, oral-poetic language. As a fellow at CESTA, Stephen is developing a digital technique for processing and visualizing the poem's use of formulas common in the poetry of Homer and Hesiod, such as 'the wine-dark sea' or even the regular occurrence of a word in a particular metrical position. This work will result in both a more detailed understanding of the*Shield* and its relationship to early Greek poetry as well as new ways to explore the complex articulation of style in oral-poetics."
David Stentiford,David,Stentiford,2015-16,/img/people/dstentiford.jpg,Charting the Discursive Envelopes of the Anthropogenic,"The foundation of my dissertation is an inquiry into the twentieth-century concept of the “anthropogenic,” a term coined by the British ecologist Arthur Tansley to describe ecosystems predominantly shaped by humans. Through my fellowship in the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis, I will be working to develop my methodological tool set to map this concept in scholarship through the twentieth and twenty first centuries. At this stage, I am interested in DH, particularly techniques of text mining and network analysis, as an exploratory method. <br />Provisional research questions include the following: As a descriptor, what objects does the term anthropogenic modify and describe over time: landscapes, emissions, climates, stratigraphy? And what envelopes of agency are drawn around the human figures standing be hind the term? Within the year at CESTA, my aim is to compose a corpus of digitized articles from scientific and social scientific journals and to produce visualizations that offer perspectives on the term’s academic usage. I plan to use these visualizations as exploratory maps for plotting a further detailed cultural history of the concept, to eventually understand more about the ways in which the term is used to frame current political debates about global change."
