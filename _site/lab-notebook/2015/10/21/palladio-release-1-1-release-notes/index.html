<p>Palladio 1.1 Release October 21, 2015</p>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<ol>
<li>General: We added a progress indicator to let you know when rendering is happening. Look for a swoosh around the Palladio &quot;P&quot; in the upper left corner.</li>
<li>Data Refine: Allow &quot;ignore&quot; option for special characters in the edit dimension view.</li>
<li>Data Refine: Red dot goes to gray for a reviewed/edited/verified dimension.</li>
<li>Map view: Allow the use of WMS URLS. YAY!!!</li>
<li>Map view: improvements to map data rendering time. </li>
<li>Map view: We have removed the &#39;mouseclick to filter&#39; on the map points. We will be replacing this with a mouseclick for popover that will give more detailed information about a point on the map than we see in the tooltip.</li>
<li>Timespan: Add the group name to the tooltip.</li>
<li>Facet Filter: show ([number selected out of] / [total number]) for each dimension. We need to let people know at a glance how many of a thing they are seeing in a view. We can do this easily with FF instead of mucking up the interface with more information.</li>
<li>Saving a project: Add date to metadata per project (more coming)</li>
<li>Saving a project: save files can reference external data (performance improvement). Including toggle option so that user can control if data is saved along with Palladio save file or is referenced in a remote location. Only available if file is loaded from URL, not if data is dragged or pasted into Palladio directly. Try putting the URL of a Dropbox file in your Public folder where you normally paste your data.</li>
<li>Saving a project: Now you can save a project from Safari browser! The save file name will be â€œUnknown.&quot; You&#39;ll need to rename it. At least the download works.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ol>
<li>Timespan: The bar layout was displaying duplicate values.</li>
<li>Facet filter: fixed a bug where the clear/remove controls stopped appearing.</li>
<li>Map view: Fixed a bug that caused the legend graphics to appear squished.</li>
<li>Data Refine: We no longer flag the data format &quot;Coordinates&quot; for review because of commas and dashes.</li>
<li>Map View: At the request of our friends at Mapbox, we added Mapbox branding when using Mapbox tiles.</li>
<li>Saving a project: Fixed a bug where saving a project would kill links/extensions.</li>
<li>General: Fixed a bug where font-awesome drag icon was not appearing.</li>
<li>Facet Filter: Fixed a bug where adding a dimension triggered multiple updates, causing slowness.</li>
<li>Data Refine: For a while, if you needed to remove a table that was extended from the primary table in order to fix it and re-load it, the re-load would fail. That has been fixed.</li>
<li>Timespan Filter: Fixed a problem where filter settings were not saved with the Palladio save file (download).</li>
<li>Facet Filter: Fixed a display problem that caused dimensions to stack.</li>
<li>Timespan Filter: Fixed a problem where, if a filter is already in place when the timespan is added, then the filter is removed, the lines will overflow the view area.</li>
</ol>
