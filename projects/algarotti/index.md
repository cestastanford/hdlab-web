The [Francesco Algarott](http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/casestudies/algarotti.html)

* an interesting visualization of Algarotti's travels and movements through his life

* a publication tree of his bestselling Newtonianism for Ladies (1737) in its many Italian editions and various translations produced from some of them or from earlier translations in other languages

* different ways to visualize his social network

* curating the data from Algarotti's published letters, both during and immediately after his lifetime in successive editions of his works.  N.B.  Cheryl prepared a basic database with one of our grad students that will need to be cleaned, enriched, and generally prepared for use in visualizations.

* explore the possibility of visualizing the metadata of Algarotti's unpublished correspondence, which Vittoria Feola in Padua is now compiling to become part of Oxford's public database of early modern letters online (EMLO).  We will be in touch with her to discuss what might be possible since she is still in the early stages of creating this inventory but it is indeed timely that she's doing it.
